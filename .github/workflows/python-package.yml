Apologies for the confusion. It seems like the script syntax is still not correct for PowerShell. Let's try a different approach. We can use the `Test-Path` cmdlet in PowerShell to check for the existence of the `requirements.txt` file. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: windows-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.12"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install flake8 pytest
        if (Test-Path requirements.txt) {
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        }
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

This should correctly check for the existence of `requirements.txt` using PowerShell syntax. If the file exists, it will proceed to install the requirements, otherwise, it will skip that step.
